## 🧠 Project Overview

This project uses machine learning models such as **Random Forest Regressor** and **XGBoost** to train on employee salary data. Model training is handled by `Model training.py` to select and save the best performer.

The web app (`app.py`) lets users:
- Enter employee details
- Predict salary using the saved model `best_salary_predictor.pkl`
- View model R² accuracy
- See feature importance charts

## 🧪 Model Information

- **RandomForestRegressor** (best model, by default)
- Trained/tested using `train_test_split`
- R² Score used for evaluation

> The training script (`Model-training.py`) performs:
> - Data cleaning and encoding
> - Model training and evaluation
> - Model selection and saving (with `joblib`)
